# BullRun: Race to the Finish (Working Title)

A Unreal Engine 5 powered battle-royale racing game.

## Elevator Pitch

_It's Sega’s OutRun as a battle royale & endless runner, 100 players race to get to each checkpoint before time runs out, if they don’t make it to the checkpoint they are eliminated. First, one to the finish line gets the bragging rights and all the glory._
